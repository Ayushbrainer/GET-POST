# get-post


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

get-post is an app which takes data from jsonPlaceholderAPI and represents it in a list form.
I have also implemented the "fake" POST method which just fools the response into thinking that it has been posted while not actually updating their API. 

  - Has a simple UI
  - There is a bottom navigation bar animation when changing pages
